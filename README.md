## Motivation

People like to tweet their [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) games as emoji.

These are inaccessible to screen reading technology.

This extension generates a text representation of the game as Twitter does not currently provide a way to add alt text to non-image Tweets.

## Example

Emoji version:

```

```

2. Two letters in wrong slot (slots 1 and 2)
